# Lexicon Exercise 6 Storage: API
This is my solution to the small exercise, Storage, which focuses on API creation and the use of Entity Framework.
Where I supplied both code and written answers to questions.

The instructions for this exercise (in Swedish) can be found here [Ã–vning 6 API.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20981794/Ovning.6.API.pdf).
